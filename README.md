# Tools made for the asteroids game:
I added a difficulty tool. In this tool you can set difficulty levels by changing parameters that are then stored in a scriptable object
and applied in runtime.
This tool uses a custom editor window to tweek the difficulty settings and apply them to the scriptable object.
It also has full undo/redo support.
